# Tensor Module API Reference

This page provides the complete API reference for the `batchtensor.tensor` module.

The tensor module contains functions for manipulating individual PyTorch tensors along batch and sequence dimensions. These functions operate on single tensors and are the foundation for the nested operations.

For usage examples and tutorials, see the [Tensor Operations User Guide](../uguide/tensor.md).
