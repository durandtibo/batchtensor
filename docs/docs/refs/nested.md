# Nested Module API Reference

This page provides the complete API reference for the `batchtensor.nested` module.

The nested module contains functions for manipulating nested data structures (dictionaries, lists, tuples) containing PyTorch tensors. All operations recursively apply to tensors within the nested structure while preserving the structure.

For usage examples and tutorials, see the [Nested Operations User Guide](../uguide/nested.md).
